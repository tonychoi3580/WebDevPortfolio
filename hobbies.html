<h3>Why I Love Cooking Instant Ramen</h3>
<p>
    You may think that instant ramen is one of the easiest dishes to cook. It comes in a ready package with noodles and a soup packet.
    All you have to do is boil water and put the noodles in. No. I want to introduce you to the world of perfectly cooked and modified
    instant ramen dishes. 
</p>

<h4>Noodle Consistency</h4>
<p>
    On the package of most instant ramens, there usually are directions that give exactly how long the noodle should be cooked for.
    This is for the utmost beginners/amateurs of the noodle world. The amount of time, the strength of the heat, the material of the pot,
    how much you stir the noodles, and the type of noodles you get are all factors that decide the consistency of the ramen noodles. For example,
    cup ramen noodles are thinner and more porous, leading to a relatively more al dente consistency when boiled at high heat compared to the 
    normal packaged ramen noodles. Some people like their noodles a bit hard and chewy. Some like their noodles a bit softer. Someone who loves
    cooking instant noodles knows how to satisfy every taste.
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>
    Instant ramen comes with all the necessary ingredients to make the ramen!! Wrong. Although there are some instant noodle enthusiast who prefer to 
    keep the pure flavor of the ramen and hate to "taint" the flavor of their ramen with other ingredients, I personally believe that the ramen package 
    is only a portion of the ingredients for the instant ramen dish. There are an almost infinite selection of instant ramens from all kinds of countries
    around the world, and each ramen goes well with different ingredients or even the same ingredients but cooked in different ways. For your classic soupy/spicy 
    instant ramen, about half the people prefer to break an egg inside and to mix it into the broth to make it taste creamier. The other half like to keep the 
    egg intact so that it becomes sort of a poached egg in the ramen soup. A small number of people - as I said above - hate even the idea of putting an egg inside 
    their ramen. 
</p>
<p>
    An egg is only the most basic of the ingredients you can add to your ramen to spice things up. My favorite kitchenware to use for cooking instant ramen - 
    you'll never guess - is a wok. This is because I can do everything I need to do in this one wok: boiling and stir-frying. Yes. Stir-frying. Stir-fried ramen noodles 
    with ingredients like pork belly, green onion, onion, and garlic with a little bit of soysauce can create an amazing dish. It is almost impossible to get completely
    sick of this dish because it will taste completely different depending on the type of ramen you use. My two favorite ramens to stir-fry are the famous korean
    fire ramen, and the Indonesian Mi Goreng ramen.

<h4>My Favorite Instant Noodles</h4>
<div>
<h5>Korean Fire Ramen</h5>

<figure>Taken by me</figure>
<p>
    This is an extremely popular and famous ramen known best for the Korean spicy noodle challenge on YouTube.
    I like to stir-fry this with about one-half of the sauce packet and soy sauce to reduce the spice and to
    bring out the flavor of fire. This ramen goes extremely well with ingredients like pork belly, green onion,
    onion, and cheese! There is even a version of this ramen called the Fire Carbonara where this ramen is mixed 
    with cream cooked with bacon and garlic to create a Carbonara/Fire Noodle. 
</p>

<h5>Jin Ramyun</h5>

<p>
    This is a Korean classic soupy instant noodle and the biggest competitor to the famous Shin ramyun brand. This brand of 
    ramyun comes in a mild and a spicy flavor. This isn't exactly the most flavorful or trendiest instant noodle, but it 
    is the most basic and a classic. I like to cook this one the original way with just maybe an egg or chopped green onions. Of course 
    you can't forget to eat kimchi with this ramen. When I want to spice it up, this noodle can provide me with an infinite number of 
    variety and options for modified ramen dishes. 
</p>

<div>
<h5>Kokomen</h5>

<p>
    Developed by a Korean celebrity, the kokomen is something different. Unlike the usual orange/red broths that most Korean instant noodles 
    use, this instant ramen uses a clear white chicken broth. This makes the soup extremely clean and crisp to the taste. This noodle goes so well 
    with green onions that I consider green onions a necessity when consuming this ramen. I enjoy this ramen when I am sick of other ramens and I want
    something new and clean-tasting. One bad thing about this ramen would be that it is relatively hard to add ingredients to it besides green onion.
    This ramen comes perfect as-is in the package (besides the green onion).

<h5>Bibim myun</h5>

<figure>Taken by me</figure>
<p>
    Last but not least is my favorite instant noodle of all time. This instant noodle incorporates a traditional Korean sweet and spicy sauce and extremely
    thin noodles to create a light salad-like dish. An interesting thing about this ramyun is that it is served best cold over ice. Ingredients that go super well
    with these noodles are bean sprouts, cucumber, and sesame oil. Boil the noodles, chill them over ice, toss the noodles with some diced cucumbers/bean sprouts and the sauce,
    and drizzle sesame oil over the final product and my favorite dish to eat with Korean BBQ is done. These noodles are cold, sweet, and spicy so it complements the
    greasiness of Korean barbeque (this ramyun goes absolutely the best with grilled pork belly).
