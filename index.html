  <li>Education: Duke University, Class of 2022</li>
  <li>Major: B.S Computer Science</li>

<h3 class = "topic1">Taste in Websites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is a good website. Not only is it clean and easy to use, it is excellent at getting its users hooked on the site.</li>
  <li>I think <a href="https://rogerhub.com/final-grade-calculator/">RogerHub</a> is a meh website. The only good things I see are that it is concise and useful. Very little effort
    seems to have gone in the website.</li>
  <li>I think <a href = "https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/">This Website</a> is a great tutorial on how to create image filters using Javascript!</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "topic1">Experience with Computer Science</h3>
<p>My first experience with a computer was my very own gameboy advance back in 2005. I was attending a kindergarten in Korea
  when my grandparents came back from the trip to the US with a tiny gaming device for me. I played Pokemon for the first time
  and was fascinated/shocked. Ever since then I would try to familiarize myself with technology. In first grade, I learned that
  by using my parent's computer and printer, I could print and sell my own rare YuGiOh cards. Looking back, the fake YuGiOh
  cards I made with a printer was pretty low quality and easy to tell from the real ones, but some of my friends traded me genuine
  rare cards for my fake ones. This is how I realized the power of technology. 
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I have used all different kinds of computers. From Windows XP,7, and 8 to MacBook Pros, I use computers on a daily
  basis to not only do homework and watch lecture videos, but also to play games and video chat with my friends. I wish I did program
  on a daily basis, but I cannot honestly say that I do. I have yet to have found the enjoyment in programming/web development and I 
  hope to find it through this course! You might be wondering why I even am a Computer Science major then in the first place. I came to
  college as a pre med student and did not switch to CS until my Junior year!! What motivated me to switch is the part I enjoy most so
  far about computer science: the coding problems. Although I haven't had enough experience in programming to enjoy software development
  or website development, I found solving coding problems and looking for ways to optimize runtime very fun and exciting. 
</p>
<p>
  I honestly have no idea what I am going to be doing in terms of programming in the future. One of the things I am very interested in 
  right now is cybersecurity. Maybe I can see myself learning about how to better security for a software product after I have learnt how
  to build software. So far I have learned Python, Java, Javascript, Swift, and SQL. With this course I hope to gain further knowledge in
  the languages/skills necessary to build web applications such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I hope to be able to become a developer that 
  can create creative and dependable software!
